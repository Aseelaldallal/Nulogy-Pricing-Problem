Step 2: Design

5 Markup Categories:
1. Flat Markup
2. Labor Markup
3. Pharmaceutical Markup
4. Food Markup
5. Electronic markup

In the future:
More categories might be added. We need to make sure that our program is easily extendible. 
Markup percentages might change. Make sure that our program is easily editable.

Things to think about:
1 - Does user know how many markup categories exist? 

Better: Tell the user what is allowed

Should I limit user input? Or keep arguments as 5?
